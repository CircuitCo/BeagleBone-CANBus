The BeagleBone CANBus Cape makes use of DCAN1 interface of the AM335x processor to provide a Controller Area Network (CAN) interface that meets the specifications of ISO11898. The CAN Bus interface can be accessed via a standard D-Sub 9 female serial connector. This connector is located to the side so it doesn't interfere with any capes stacked above it. The BeagleBone CANBus Cape also supports SocketCAN.
